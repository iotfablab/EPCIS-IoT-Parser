# EPCIS-IoT-Parser

This script parses the incoming data from IoT Sensor Nodes using [EPCIS-IoT-Arduino](https://github.com/iotfablab/EPCIS-IoT-Arduino) and adds the additional Meta-data as __Tags__ for InfluxDB.

## Hardware

- This script can be run on any hardware that supports EPCIS Information handling from RFID gates as well as an MQTT Broker.

- Currently the script is used on [Nordic ID AR82 RFID Reader](https://www.nordicid.com/wp-content/uploads/Nordic_ID_AR82_User_Guide_1v3.pdf)

## Usage on Nordic ID AR82

1. Login into the __Nordic ID AR82__ reader via it's IP address or mDNS address e.g. `arMACADDRESS.local`

2. On the __Nordic ID AR82__ create a new application (admin rights required) by clicking the Applications Icon

    ![ApplicationMgmtIcon](./.github/ApplicationManagement.png)

3. Create a Blank Application and name it `epcisiotparser`

    ![BlankApplication](./.github/BlankApp.png)

   This should create a password which will be used later

    ![AppCredentials](./.github/AppCredentials.png)


4. Log into the reader via `ssh` and the application credentials:

        ssh -l epcisiotparser <IP_Address_of_AR82_Reader>
   
   Password should be one generated via the App.

5. Copy the contents of the `epcisiotparser/bin` folder to the present working directory on the reader.

        $ pwd # on reader
        /mnt/userdata/apps/epcisiot/bin

    Copy the `epcisiotreader/bin` to the reader using `scp`:

        $ # on your pc
        $ scp epcisiotparser/bin/* epcisiotparser@<AR82_IP_Address>:/mnt/userdata/apps/epcisiotparser/bin
    
    Copy the `epcisiotreader/properties` to respective directory on reader:

        $ scp epcisiotreader/properties/* epcisiotparser@<AR82_IP_Address>:/mnt/userdata/apps/epcisiotparser/properties

6. Install the Dependencies using: 
        
        pip install --user -r requirements.txt
    
    If installation fails, install them manually using:

        pip install --user toml \
                            pymongo \
                            influxdb \
                            paho-mqtt

7. Change the `config.toml` file with information about Document-Driven Database, Sensor Database (InfluxDB) and MQTT Broker

8. Check the MQTT Broker settings on the Reader by clicking on __Services__ in the Web App.

    ![MQTTSettings](./.github/MQTTSettings.png)

9. Change/Check the WLAN Access Point Settings in Networking Tab:

    ![AccessPointSettings](./.github/AccessPointSettings.png)

10. Start the Application from the Application List and Observe the Logs in System Logging Tab. Use the dropdown menu to find the logs of the app
    under `apps/epcisiotparser/epcisiotparser.log`
